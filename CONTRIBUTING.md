## Getting Started
If you're reporting a bug or requesting a new feature, please review the existing Issues first to ensure that yours is not a duplicate. If you find an existing Issue that yours would duplicate, please do add your voice or context to that conversation. If you don't find an existing Issue, please open a new one. 

### Bugs

  * Remote OS
  * Extension
  * IDE
* Applicable configuration files

If you're **submitting a pull request to patch an existing bug**, please include a clear description of the bug as well as your solution. If the bug was reported previously, please also include a link to the Issue #.

### Feature Requests

We love new features! If you **have an idea** you would like to submit, please include the following information:

* Describe the feature in a clear and succinct manner

If you're **submitting a pull request to implement a new feature**, please include the above information and a detailed description of your implementation.
